\section{Introduction}
%TODO Talk first about the interest to analyze the relations blabla
%TODO Then, "With this aim, the software in this document has born
The software described in this document is born with the aim to analyze
the relations between notes patterns in guitar
solos, often called guitar licks. The choose of guitar solos has been taken 
because of the large amount of data available online but the subject may 
be extended to
different, but similar, kind of data. For example drum patterns
relations in jam sessions or other instruments executions, compositions
and improvisations may be considered. It has been chosen to represent
the data elements and their relations within a network, as to the
means offered by the graph theory useful in a mathematical analysis.\\
The area of scientific research
that usually is interested in the empirical study of real-world network
,such this one, is the study of \emph{Complex Networks}.
